          At <span className="font-semibold text-blue-500">WarmlyBD</span>, we
          believe that no one should suffer the cold. Every year, countless
          people in Bangladesh face winter without proper clothing. Our mission
          is to bridge the gap by connecting donors with those in need.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg">
          You can help by donating your unused winter clothes â€” jackets,
          sweaters, blankets, and more. Together, we can spread warmth and bring
          smiles across the country, one piece of clothing at a time.
